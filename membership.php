			<div>
				<p>
					In 2017 Fencing New Zealand has introduced a centralised registration system for all the regions in NZ. 
					To register for this year go to the 
					<a href="http://www.dev.fencing.org.nz/" target="_blank">FENZ registration page</a>, select Fencing Mid South, and follow the instructions.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you are asked to specify your Fencing Club, if you fence only for (or at) your school, select "Other". You can specify you school in the following box.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you became a member to fence in the U13 Inter-cities Competition last December, you have already paid for your membership. You will be sent a separate email with a code to enter into the system as part of your registration.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you have already updated your membership via the Mid-South revolution sport site, an email will be sent with a code to activate your membership in the central registration system also.
