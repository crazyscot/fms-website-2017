<H1>KEITH STUART MANN</H1>
Born 01.05.1932, London, England.

<p>
	Raised during wartime in Britain he completed his education at Pangbourne College where, as a Cadet RNR he trained for a career as a deck officer in the Merchant Navy. Scholastic achievement included Matriculation at credit level in seven general subjects and two vocational subjects.
</p>


<p>
	An activity encouraged by parents was learning to play the piano which helped later involvement in playing the ukulele banjo, fife, piccolo, mouth organ, bones and guitar.</p>

<p>
	The College provided wide opportunities for involvement in sport and he was active in rugby - first fifteen, hockey, swimming and diving, vaulting, sailing, small bore shooting, boxing and fencing. The latter sport ultimately took precedence over the others and when Captain of Fencing in his last year he won both the Under 16 Cadets, and the Under 20 Junior Officers Championship of the British armed services at the 1948 Royal Tournament.
</p>

<P>
	On leaving college after four years he joined Blue Star Line as a cadet with a career path leading to Captain in the merchant navy. At 19 he was Fourth Officer and Third Officer at 20. He passed the exams for Second Officer in 1952 and First Officer in 1954 but left the sea in 1956, before sitting for his Masters Certificate, and emigrated to New Zealand where he married and started a totally new career in commerce. To further his career prospects he studied for a Diploma in Business Management (MNZIM) and completed the qualification in one year less than usual.
</P>

<P>
	Progress in the sales and marketing discipline within a multinational company was steady and, starting from scratch, within six years became Branch Manager and shortly thereafter Area Manager. 
</P>

<P>
	During this period active involvement in fencing competition resumed, with several national titles and top three placings, and proceeded together with a developing involvement in coaching and the administration of the sport. 
</P>

<P>
	Concurrently the growth of a young family fostered existing interests and activity in cycling, down-hill skiing, ice skating, squash, trout fishing and ‘rock hounding’ with supporting roles in swimming, soccer and rugby. A long term, and “totally unspectacular”, involvement in golf commenced.	
</P>

<P>
	The company he worked for recognized excellence in sports. Participation in four British Empire and Commonwealth Games as a competitor, Perth 1962 and Kingston 1966, team official, Edindurgh 1970, and control committee official, Christchurch 1974, received its support and leave of absence with pay.
</P>

<P>
	Advancement in sport and commerce proceeded at the same time. At 35 he was the youngest person to be elected President of the New Zealand Amateur Fencing Association and shortly thereafter he was transferred to his company’s Divisional Head Office to become part of the management team.
</P>

<P>
	The 1970’s brought a number of challenges and changes. Discussion with a boxing official at the Edinburgh Games high lighted the fact that Fencing had been dropped from the calendar of optional sports for the 1974 Christchurch Games. This led to an offer to become involved in the boxing administration for those Games and he became a member of the Boxing Control Committee. “An interesting and rewarding” three year experience which the Chairman of the Committee, Sid Ashton, has commented on very favorably. It also provided the opportunity to renew the 1966 acquaintance, and develop the friendship, of Bill Kini, heavyweight gold medalist at Kingston, who was the role model of the boxing fraternity.
</P>

<P>
	On the fencing scene, after a three year term as National President, he was appointed Sole National Selector and held this position for a period of nine years until he voluntarily stepped down pending a transfer overseas.
</P>

<P>
	During this period he qualified as an International Referee, B grade (able to referee in the French language). Involved in raising funds for a team to participate in the 1979 World Fencing Championships he then helped manage that team at the event. A long term wish to be at the Olympics did not come to pass when, as a result of the international pressure to boycott the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, he resigned from the appointment as section manager. 
</P>

<P>
	On the commercial front he was head hunted in the mid 1970’s to join the management team of another organization. The company became the subject of a takeover and a substantial rationalization and reduction in activities led to widespread redundancies, including his own job. He was offered a similar position with his previous company and rejoined it after an absence of three years.
</P>

<P>
	In 1982 he was made a Life Member of the Fencing Association.
</P>

<p>
	In 1983 he was transferred to Hong Kong on a four year posting to take up the position of  General Manager and Director of a subsidiary company. Duties called for regular travel to Far Eastern countries. China, not long out of the cultural revolution, was opening up to foreign businessmen and travelers. The Chinese authorities were receptive to new products and technologies and issued invitations to him to present lectures to architectural institutes in a number of cities throughout China. In addition there were negotiations covering the possibility of the Chinese manufacturing some of the company’s products in Shanghai. Towards the end of the posting another subsidiary, in Singapore was placed under his control.
</p>

<p>
	On returning to New Zealand his principal activity was to manage the introduction to, and development of, the local market for an imported specialized product range to be locally processed. This involved on site management of storage and environmental protection  installations eg. reservoirs, tank farms (oil and petrol storage), disposal areas for rubbish and contaminated material (one of which was 23 hectares in area). The product range was of American origin and liaison with the principals involving visits to Houston was an ongoing responsibility. On retirement at age 60 he continued his association with his employer via his own private company, set up for that purpose, and latterly as a consultant, for the next ten years.
</p>

<p>
	In the meantime active participation in fencing resumed. In competition at Masters level, coaching at club level and in administration at the national level. At age sixty two, in 1994, history repeated itself with his appointment again as National President, followed, after the expiry of the term, by appointment again as a National Selector.
	
</p>

<p>
	Concurrently he became a member of Winter Games Promotion Inc. working on the feasibility of holding the Winter Olympics in New Zealand. In the early stage being involved mostly in budgetary matters, then as Chairman of the Sports Committee and finally as Chairman of a sub-committee reviewing the timetable. It is worthy of note that the International Olympic Committee requirements for a bid dramatically changed so that a total in excess of thirty approvals had to be in place before the bid would be accepted. The result being that the timetable had to be extended substantially and the proposed date for holding the Games no longer was practical.	
</p>

<p>
	During this time he began what has become a continuing interest in lawn bowls. Several club titles have been won and he became a club committee member with a particular brief to review constitutional matters.	
</p>

<p>
	Involvement in the management of fencing teams continued. In 1998 to the Commonwealth Championships in Kuala Lumpur, as Liaison Officer with the Commonwealth Fencing Federation and as a Coach, and to the 2002 Commonwealth Championships in Newcastle, Australia, as Chef de Mission.	
</p>

<p>
	Always being supported in his endeavors by his wife it was appropriate that in that year he, in turn, joined her in a challenge to join a Toastmasters International club. The result, “a most entertaining and enjoyable association” which led to the award of Competent Toastmaster then Advanced Communicator Silver and completion of the projects for the Advanced Communicator Gold.	
</p>

<p>
	The attraction of combat did not diminish and at the Commonwealth Veterans Championships, in Sydney 2003, after being placed about half way in the overall tournament of 40+ fencers, he won two gold medals in the 70+ age bracket. The following year saw gold medals in all three weapons, foil, epee and sabre at the Oceania Fencing Championships. 
</p>

<p>
	Later in 2003 he was a Technical Official, Fencing, in the World Wheelchair Games held in Christchurch and followed this with involvement as a member of the Events Committee of the 2005 Special Olympics, for athletes with learning disabilities, also held in Christchurch. “Both rewarding experiences”.
</p>

<p>
	In 2004 he was the first recipient of a Special Award by the Fencing Association in recognition of his continuing service to the sport.
</p>

<p>
	In the 2007 New Years Honours he was named as a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, MNZM, for services to sport and especially Fencing.
</p>

<p>
	The 2010 and 2011 Christchurch earthquakes, and the 3000 or so aftershocks, were not pleasant experiences but not as unnerving for him as for many people since, whilst a cadet in the merchant navy the vessel he was sailing on, an American built Liberty Ship with known structural weakness (!), went through the eye of a hurricane with off the scale winds and mountainous seas. On return to the UK the vessel was put into dry dock for 6 weeks for structural repairs to be carried out. Later, shortly after being posted to Hong Kong a typhoon made a direct hit on the port city causing substantial damage and everything was shut down for several days.
