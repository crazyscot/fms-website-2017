	<span class="c4 c6">rd</span>
	<span class="c0">). He also won his first National Epee Championship. He was also selected for the 1980 Moscow Olympics, but then under pressure from the government to join the US led boycott of the games, the National Federation withdrew him, just before the Games start.</span>
