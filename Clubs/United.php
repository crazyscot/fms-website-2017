            <h1>United Fencing Club</h1>
			<h2>Uniting UFC, CFA and FOCUS</h2>
			<h2>Where and when</h2>
				<p>Lessons start March 3rd.</p>
				<p>We will meet at Shirley Intermediate School Hall at 7.00 pm  on Tuesdays. Enter the School off North Parade. The Hall is to the 
					left of the  Admin Block and parking is available in the grounds.
				</p>
				<p>Our normal programme includes a warm-up, foot work, move  of the day, group and individual lessons and bout fencing. We concentrate 
					on  foil for beginners and introduce epee and sabre to more experienced fencers.
					All our  coaches are very experienced as fencers, administrators and coaches, locally  and nationally. 
					They volunteer their time and experience so our fees are low.
				</p>
			<h2>Membership</h2>  
				<p>The $130 club fee includes affiliation to the  regional and national body for the year and entitles you to take part in events  in NZ. 
					Fees are to be paid to the Treasurer by the third week of March. A  special family group fee can be arranged.
				</p>
			<h2>Beginner Classes</h2>
				<p>The introduction to fencing course will run for eight sessions usually  starting on the first Tuesday in March at 7 – 8.00pm initially, cost $60. 
					This  fee will count towards your club membership if you decide to join for the year.  We will gradually extend the time and introduce individual lessons 
					as your knowledge/  interest in fencing grows. 
				</p>
				<p>United has  been introducing fencers to the sport for more than 50 years. Many of our  fencers have won Canterbury and New Zealand senior, 
					U20s and school titles and all our fencers have enjoyed the sport and art of  fencing. Parents often learn along with their children. 
				</p>
