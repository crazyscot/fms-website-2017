				<p>
				One of Fencing Mid-South's main activities is running regional competitions. These
				competitions give the fencers from our member-clubs a chance to come together and fence
				people from other clubs in the region and from around the country. 
				</p>
				<p>				
				We also take turns, with the three other regional fencing bodies, at running the
				FENZ national competitions. Because we don't always run the national competitions, 
				we don't have all the information about these competitions available here.
				</p>
				<p>	
				In addition to Regional and National competitions, there are also local club competitions,
				which we show here to help publiscise the competitions.
				As with National competitions, we often don't have all the information for club competitions available
				here.
				</p>				
				<p>				
				For more information about up-coming competitions, please refer to 
				our <a href="https://www.revolutionise.com.au/fencingmidsouth/events/calendar/" target="_blank">competition calendar</a>.
