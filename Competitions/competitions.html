One of Fencing Mid-South's main activities is running regional competitions. These
competitions give the fencers from our member-clubs a chance to come together and fence
people from other clubs in the region and from around the country. 
</p>
<p>				
We also take turns, with the three other regional fencing bodies, at running the
FENZ national competitions. Because we don't always run the national competitions, 
we don't have all the information about these competitions available here.
</p>
<p>	
In addition to Regional and National competitions, there are also local club competitions,
which we show here to help publiscise the competitions.
As with National competitions, we often don't have all the information for club competitions available
here.
