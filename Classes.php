					<h1>Fencing Classes</h1>
					<p>
						Fencing MidSouth runs a fencing training programme in schools around Christchurch. 
						We work in conjunction with the schools to provide fencing as an option at the school.
					</p>
					<p>
						The classes are coached by our older and more experienced youth fencers, 
						mostly year 13 or older, with oversight by senior coaches from MidSouth. Our 
						junior coaches themselves are part of a coaching development programme being 
						run by MidSouth and are part of our high performance fencing squad. All our junior 
						and senior coaches have international experience. One of our senior coaches represented
						New Zealand at the Olympics, and one of our junior coaches at the Youth Olympics.
					</p>
					<p>
						Children who want to continue with fencing will be encouraged continue with
						their school class as well as have individual lessons and to join a club, where 
						they will be able to fence with a wider range of fencers, and receive more 
						opportunities for coaching and development.
					</p>
