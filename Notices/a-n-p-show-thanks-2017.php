<h2>A&P Show fund raising</h2>
<p>
	Thanks to everyone who showed up for our annual fund raiser, colleting rubbish at the A&P show.  
</p>
<p>
	We've done this three years in a row now, and it's a surprisingly fun, easy and profitable fund raiser. This
	year 28 people helped out across two time-slots, and we made $1197 dollars. 
</p>
<p>
	Special thanks to United club who brought a big group on the Saturday!
