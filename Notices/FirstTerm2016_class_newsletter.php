<h2>Fencing Classes</h2>
<p>This year Fencing MidSouth has been given an opportunity to run a centrally-organised 
fencing training programme. Classes have started but it's not to late to join. More
information is available on 
our <a href="http://www.fencingmidsouth.org.nz/Clubs.php">Clubs and Training</a> page.

Our first newsletter for fencing classes is out now, being handed out at classes 
and <a href="./Documents/First Term School Fencing Class Newletter.pdf" target="_blank">available here</a>.
