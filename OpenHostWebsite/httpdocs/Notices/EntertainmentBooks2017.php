  As a region we are selling Entertainment books again in 2017 to raise money to support Youth development.

  In 2016 we raised $600 and this year our goal is to raise $1000

  You can purchase entertainments books for not only Canterbury/ Nelson region but any region in New Zealand or Australia. 
  Advantages of this is you can see if friends and family from other cities wish to purchase an entertainment book through you or if you have a holiday home eg: in Wanaka or are planning a week/ weekend jaunt across the ditch you can purchase a book that will entitle you to discounts while you are away.

<p>
  Entertainment books can be purchased as the traditional coupon book and gold card or the new online ap which can be loaded on 1 or 2 devices.
