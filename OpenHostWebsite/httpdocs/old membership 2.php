			<h2>How to join</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
				This year we have implemented a new membership registration system, through a sports-club membership service called 
				<a href="https://www.revolutionise.com.au/" target="_blank">Revolutionise Sport</a>. This system allows people 
				to register themselves online through the web site, manage their own details,
				and optionally pay online via credit card or paypal. This should make it much easier for members to join, and 
				also make it easier for clubs and MidSouth to manage memberships, know who is a member, communicate with members, etc.
				</p>
				<p>Alternatively some clubs may collect registration details and money, and manage their members affiliation as part
				of the club-membership. Your club will let you know if they will handle your affiliation as part of your club-membership.
				</p>
				<h3>The self-registration process</h3>
				<p> 
				<ol>
					<li>
						<a href="https://www.revolutionise.com.au/fencingmidsouth/registration/" target="_blank">Go here to register for the first time</a>, click Register, and create a login. 
						Apart from providing your contact details you will need to 
						<ul>
							<li>choose your primary club</li>
							<li>choose whether you are joining as a full member (total $65), or just an associate member ($35). 
								Full members fence in competitions; associate members don't fence, but get to participate in other events and vote at the AGM. 
								Most people will want to join as Full Members.
								</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						After you have created an account (usually about 10 seconds later) you will be emailed an invoice. There are two ways you can pay:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Deposit money directly into our bank account (Westpac bank, 03 0802 0087494 00). Please be sure 
								to include your name or your invoice number in the transaction reference
							</li>
							<li>
								Pay online, using either PayPal, or credit or debit card. Note that if you opt to pay by credit or
								debit card, the transaction is still handled by Paypal. They will ask if you want to create a 
								PayPal account, but you don't have to if you don't want to.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
				<h3>Club administrators</h3>
				<p>
					Clubs can have a member set to be a Club Administrator. A Club Administrator can log in and manage
					the details for their own members. They can
					<ul>
						<li>Add and remove members of their own club</li>
						<li>Edit their own members details including name, address, etc</li>
						<li>Set their own member status, e.g. Full Member, Associate</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="mailto:webmaster@fencingmidsouth.org.nz">Contact Mid-South </a>if you want to be set up as your club administrator.
				</p>
				<h3>Bulk uploads</h3>
				<p>
					If you have your current club-membership list in a spreadsheet, you can automatically load
					your membership list directly from the spreadsheet.
					<ol>
						<li>Make a copy of your membership list, so you can work on the copy rather than the original</li>
						<li>Make sure that nobody on your list is already registered with Mid South, and make sure that there are no duplicates in your list.</li>
						<li><a href="http://fencingmidsouth.org.nz/Documents/revolutionise-FencingMidSouth-Import-Template.csv" download >Download</a> the attached spreadsheet template, which you can open in Excel or something similar</li>
						<li>Reorder your spreadsheet so that it has the same columns, in the same order, with the same column headers, as the downloaded template.</li>
						<li>Send us your re-ordered spreadsheet, and we will import the list for you</li>
					</ul>
