				<h1>Trophies and awards</h1>
				<p>
					Mid South have a collection of awards - cups, trophies etc - that have been presented to members over the years. Many of these awards  
					were presented by fencers of note, or are to commemorate fencers of note, and have a prestigous history. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Here we document these awards, the people who they honor, and the people who have held the trohpies.
				</p>
				<p>
					We also document other awards that don't belong to Fencing Mid South, but are important to our region, for example 
					South Island awards and awards by clubs in our region.
				</p>
				<p>
					We have only just begun to document this part of our history. Over the next few months we will be contacting
					the people who donated trophies, and people who might be able to help fill in the missing history. If you have any relevant information 
					that you think would be useful to put on these pages, please <a href="http://www.fencingmidsouth.org.nz/Contact.php">contact us</a>.
