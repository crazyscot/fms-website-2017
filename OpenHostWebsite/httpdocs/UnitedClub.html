             <p><strong><u>Welcome to United Fencing Club.</u></strong></p>
             <p align="left">Our Fencing Club is located at Shirley Intermediate   School, in the Gymnasium.  Access is from North Parade, entrance just past Shirley Boys High. <br>
               Our Club  Night is every Tuesday, commencing at 7pm. <br>
               <br>
               We will be having our opening night for the 2015  season, on Tuesday the 24th. February at 7.00 pm. This night will be for Senior Fencers and Fencers with a year or more experience. We will be Fencing until 8.30pm, and  then at 8.45pm, our AGM.</p>
             <p align="left">The School occasionally has to use the Gymnasium for  School matters on a Tuesday evening, but we are advised well in advance of  these requirements, and we will advise you of this when necessary.<br>
               We coach in all three weapons, Foil, Epee &amp;  Sabre, but with the main emphasis on foil for beginners.</p>
             <p align="left">On Tuesday the 3rd. March at 7pm, all new and  beginner Fencers will  commence. <br>
               Beginners should wear track pants or  long stretch trousers, gym shoes, [compulsory],<br>
               tee shirt, and if possible, any type  of glove for their Fencing hand.</p>
             <p align="left">Note: - NO shorts,  jandals, sandals, bare feet or jeans please.</p>
             <p align="left">Fencers with a year or more experience will start at  7.00pm with a warm up and footwork session, followed by coaching, either in a  group, or individually. <br>
               The Club has weapons, clothing, masks etc. for use by  beginners, and if the new fencers wish to continue, we encourage them to  purchase their own gear. We can advise on this.</p>
             <p align="left">The Club annual fees are $130.00 for all Fencers.  These fees include affiliation to Fencing New Zealand [FENZ] and CPAFC [Fencing  Mid South]. You must  be affiliated to FENZ and Fencing Mid South, to take part in competitions/events  that are run by these organisations. </p>
             <p align="left">Our final Fencing night has not been decided yet, but  this will be advised to you all at a later date.  </p>
             <p align="left">All Club Fees should be paid by 19th March  2015.</p>
             <p align="left">United Fencing looks forward to seeing you at the  Club.<br>
