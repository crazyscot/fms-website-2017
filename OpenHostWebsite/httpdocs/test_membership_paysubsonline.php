			<h2> How to join</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
				This year we are implementing a new membership system, through a sports-club membership service called 
				Revolutionise Sport. This system allows people to request membership online through the web site, manage their own details,
				and in future to also pay online via credit card or paypal. This should make it much easier for members to join, and 
				also make it easier for us to manage membership, know who is a member, communicate with members, etc.
				</p>
				<p> 
				<a href="https://paysubsonline.com/Registration/35B7254AA37E4D3C7238C67E078F1917.htm" target="_blank">Go here to register for the first time</a> and create a login. Apart from providing your contact details you will need to 
				<ul>
					<li>choose your primary club</li>
					<li>choose whether you are joining as a full member (total $60), or just an associate member ($30). Full members fence in competitions; associate members don't fence, but get to participate in other events and vote at the AGM. </li>
				</ul>
				After you have created an account, you will need to pay either via online banking or by sending a cheque to Mid South. When we have received payment your
				membership for the year will be confirmed.
